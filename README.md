# A L S A
This project concerns 
Electric cars will become more common. utilising cheaper technology and global energy sustainability. EV charging is the biggest criticism.
<br><br>Petrol stations are ubiquitous nationwide because many people use them for their commutes. After switching to EVs, individuals lose access to most petrol stations, which is shocking given how common they are. It affects their viability since non-urban residents may not have easy access to charging stations.
<br><br>The ALSA app lets users see the nearby locations of EV owners, and for a small fee, they can use their charging stations to travel longer distances without worrying about running out of charge.
